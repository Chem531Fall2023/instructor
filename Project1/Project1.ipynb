    "For computational work in quantum mechanics/quantum chemistry we use **atomic units** (in some computational software, you may find abberivations as **a.u.**). Will get into these in detail in class. Or you can check these out online. In these units distances are in **bohrs**, masses are in electron mass units (the mass of the electron = 1 in these), energies are **hartrees**. In these unit ℏ = 1 and that is a big help in the Schroedinger equation. We use these units in the following Hamiltonian for the harmonic oscillator\n",

    "4. Once this is set up we need to decide on “reasonable” values of L and the size of the H-matrix to set up and diagonalize. Start with L = 4 and a 10x10 matrix (remember it is symmetric so you don’t need to evaluate every element independently.) Some helpful points about this. We know the exact energy eigenvalues of the HO, they are $E_v = \\hbar\\omega(\\nu+\\frac{1}{2})$. So we know the answer in atomic units. Plot these as horizontal lines on your own plot of the potential in atomic units and let $v$ go up to say 5. The “box” has to encompass the range of the potential where the potential equals $E_v$. (These are called “classical turning points”.) Obviously, the range increases with $v$ so the size of box will have to increase as we try to describe higher and higher vibrational states."
