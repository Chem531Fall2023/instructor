    "Use VSCF to solve the ground state energy and wave function of this coupled oscillator problem. Use the product of the ground state of the two harmonic oscillators $h_1$ and $h_2$ as the initial guess. Plot the VSCF solution together with the harmonic approximation solution, as shown in FIG 1 of the paper.\n",

    "(1) When solving each iteration of the VSCF, use the numerical solution of PDE boundary problem as discussed in the class. You can use the provided PDE_BV_HO.ipynb as your starting point.\n",

    "(2) Alternatively, you can use the linear variational theorem. Try using the harmonic oscillator wave functions as the the basis function. You can also use PIB basis function if you like.\n",

    "(3) Another situation of the VSCF is the coupling through momentum, as shown in Eq (2.7). Prove why Eq (2.10a) and (2.10b) are the corresponding VSCF equations. Find out the expression of the expectation value of the total Hamiltonian.\n",
