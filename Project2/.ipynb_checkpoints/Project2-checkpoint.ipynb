For case a), use a PIB basis (box 0 to L) to obtain the first 5 energy eigenvalues and wavefunctions converged to at least three significant figures.  Use the reduced mass of the H$_2$ molecule, which is $m_\\mathrm{p}$/2.(Don't forget to convert it to the mass in atomic units, where the unit is $m_e$!). Thinks about how to locate the box. One approach is to set the center the box at $R_e$. Maybe there is a better location. The basisw should have no less than 20 PIB functions."
